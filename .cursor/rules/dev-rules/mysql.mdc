To ensure clarity and consistency in table naming, we adopt the following prefix rules:

    Master tables: Prefix with mst_
    (These are reference or lookup tables that store static or rarely changing data.)

        Example: mst_user_role, mst_country

    Transactional or general data tables: Prefix with tbl_
    (These hold dynamic, operational data used in day-to-day processes.)

        Example: tbl_user, tbl_order
